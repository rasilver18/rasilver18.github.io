              I'm Rachael Silver, a Software Developer located in Cleveland, OH.
              I am currently enrolled in We Can Code IT's full-stack Software
              Development Program. I come from a background in recruiting and
              International Studies, where I was able to develop empathetic
              approaches to every day interations and problem solving. I also
              run my own small online shop selling items I create utilizing
              epoxy resin. It is this amalgamation of diverse skillsets that
              make development an ideal environment from me. I love being able
              to utilize my creativity in every day life and working in
              collaborative work spaces. Software Development allows me to
              leverage these skillsets and others into successful projects. For
              more information, please visit my

                This is a simple project coded in Java utlizing Intellij IDEA.
                Built using TDD, this project also includes a simple main class
                and app class allowing for user interaction. This application is
                designed to be an interactive virtual pet. It allows a user to
                name their pet, select if it is a cat or a dog, and even the
                color! The application then returns an image of the user's pet
                and allows the user to the interact with the pet through
                feeding, playing, and more.

                This project is an expansion on the Virtual Pet Project.
                Utilizing Java, TDD, and IntelliJ, this project incorporated new
                techniques such as utilizing OOP techniques, interfaces, and
                abstract classes. This application, while allowing the user to
                do all of the above activities, also allowed for activities to
                only be completed given a pet being Robotic, Organic, or a dog
                or a cat. For example, robotic pets can only be oiled while
                organic pets can be fed and given water. In addition, I utilized
                interfaces to allow for specific activities for dogs and cats
                such as walking the dogs and allowing cats to use a litterbox.
