            I'm Rachael Silver, a Software Developer located in Cleveland, OH. I
            am currently enrolled in We Can Code IT's full-stack Software
            Development Program. I come from a background in recruiting and
            International Studies, where I was able to develop empathetic
            approaches to every day interations and problem solving. I also run
            my own small online shop selling items I create utilizing epoxy
            resin. It is this amalgamation of diverse skillsets that make
            development an ideal environment from me. I love being able to
            utilize my creativity in every day life and working in collaborative
            work spaces. Software Development allows me to leverage these
            skillsets and others into successful projects. For more information,
            please visit my

            <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>

            />
            <p>
              This is a simple project coded in Java utlizing Intellij IDEA.
              Built using TDD, this project also includes a simple main class
              and app class allowing for user interaction. This application is
              designed to be an interactive virtual pet. It allows a user to
              name their pet, select if it is a cat or a dog, and even the
              color! The application then returns an image of the user's pet and
              allows the user to the interact with the pet through feeding,
              playing, and more.

              alt="An image of a code class. Features code written to allow for a pet to be adopted or intake"
            />
            <p>
              This project is an expansion on the Virtual Pet Project. Utilizing
              Java, TDD, and IntelliJ, this project incorporated new techniques
              such as hashmaps, and the ability to add or remove entities given
              user command. This application allows the user to act as if they
              are working in a virtual pet shelter, helping animlas get adopt,
              performing intakes and interacting with the animals in order to
              maintain their character levels.

              This project is an expansion on the Virtual Pet Project. Utilizing
              Java, TDD, and IntelliJ, this project incorporated new techniques
              such as utilizing OOP techniques, interfaces, and abstract
              classes. This application, while allowing the user to do all of
              the above activities, also allowed for activities to only be
              completed given a pet being Robotic, Organic, or a dog or a cat.
              For example, robotic pets can only be oiled while organic pets can
              be fed and given water. In addition, I utilized interfaces to
              allow for specific activities for dogs and cats such as walking
              the dogs and allowing cats to use a litterbox.
